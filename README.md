## In-App Browser tests

This is a initial commit testing In-app browser capabilities. In-app browsers open browser windows within an external app - e.g: Facebook or Google app. They disable certain functionalities but till date there isn't a resource to tell you what is exactly disabled or does work properly.

This project aspires to be the `caniuse` of in-app browsers

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Share the URL to Facebook or Google app ( private mode) - This runs all modernizr tests and a test of retaining a localstorage item _More tests to follow)
